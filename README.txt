TIPS
====

As this font is distributed at no cost, we are unable to provide a
commercial level of personal technical support. If you do find a problem,
please create an issue in the repository or report it to fonts@sil.org.
We can't guarantee any direct response, but will try to fix reported bugs in
future versions.

Many problems can be solved, or at least explained, through an understanding
of the encoding and use of the fonts. Here are some basic hints:

Encoding:
The font is encoded according to Unicode, so your application must support
Unicode text in order to access letters other than the standard alphabet.
Most Windows applications provide basic Unicode support. You will, however,
need some way of entering Unicode text into your document.

Keyboarding:
This font can be used with any Unicode Limbu keyboarding program.
At this point we have not provided any keyboard.

Rendering:
This font is designed to work with the Opentype advanced font
technology. To take advantage of the advanced typographic
capabilities of this font, you must be using applications that provide an
adequate level of support for OpenType.
