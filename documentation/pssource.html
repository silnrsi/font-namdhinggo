<h2 id="about">About</h2>
<strong>Namdhinggo</strong> is a Unicode font for the Limbu writing system of Nepal. It provides glyphs for all Limbu characters and some Latin.

The Limbu, or Kirat Sirijonga, script is used by around 400,000 people in Nepal and India. This Unicode-encoded font has been designed to support literacy and materials development in the Limbu language.

According to traditional histories the Limbu script was developed by King Sirijonga in the 9th Century. It then fell out of use before being reintroduced in the 18th century by Teongsi Sirijonga (1704-1741) whom many felt to be the reincarnation of the first Sirijonga. The modern Sirijonga was apparently martyred in 1741 for the sake of this script by lamas in Sikkim. The script was named 'Sirijonga' in his honour by the Limbu scholar Iman Singh Chemjong.

The Devanagari "bit" is set in this font to prevent unwarranted font switching when U+0965 DEVANAGARI DOUBLE DANDA is used. However, U+0965 is the only character from the Devanagari block in this font.

Inclusion of basic Latin characters is provided as a convenience for use in menus or for displaying markup in text files, for example. These fonts are not intended for extensive Latin script use. A utility such as <a href="https://scripts.sil.org/ViewGlyph_home" title="" class="external">SIL ViewGlyph</a> can be used to examine the exact repertoire of this font.
<h3>Data Conversion</h3>
If you have existing data using the now-obsolete <em>Namdhinggo SIL L</em> font and wish to convert your data to Unicode, you may use the [Limbu-legacy to Limbu Unicode](https://github.com/silnrsi/wsresources/tree/master/scripts/Limb/legacy/limbu-dc/mappings){.external} TECkit mapping file to convert documents (text or Word) to Unicode. Since Namdhinggo SIL L used an encoding that is common among other fonts for the script it is possible that this mapping file will work for texts using those custom-encoded Limbu fonts.

The [DevaUni-LimUni](https://github.com/silnrsi/wsresources/tree/master/scripts/Limb/mappings/deva-limb){.exterrnal} TECkit mapping file (also available in downloads) gives the ability to convert between Unicode-encoded Devanagari script and Unicode-encoded Limbu script.

Both maps can be used with <a href="https://software.sil.org/teckit/" title="" class="external">TECkit</a> and/or <a href="https://software.sil.org/silconverters/" title="" class="external">SILConverters</a>.

<em>(The Namdhinggo SIL L 8-bit legacy font is available for download below in case you no longer have it installed but still need it.)</em>
<h3>Keyboarding</h3>
Two separate Keyman keyboards are available.
<ul>
 	<li>The <a href='https://keyman.com/keyboards/sil_limbu_phonetic' title="" class="external">Limbu Phonetic (SIL)</a> keyboard uses a Romanized layout, where the Limbu characters are located on the corresponding Latin keys (Limbu U+1901 LIMBU LETTER KA is on the 'k' key, etc.).</li>
 	<li>The <a href='https://keyman.com/keyboards/sil_limbu_typewriter' title="" class="external">Limbu Typewriter (SIL)</a> is the "Typewriter" layout, which roughly matches the layout of a manual Devanagari typewriter.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rendering</h3>
This font is designed to work with the OpenType advanced font technology. To take advantage of the advanced typographic capability of this font, you must be using applications that provide an adequate level of support for OpenType. See the Release Notes for version 2.000 below for more details.
