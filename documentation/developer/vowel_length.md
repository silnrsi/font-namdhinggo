# Limbu minimal pairs involving vowel length

The kemphreng (U+193A LIMBU SIGN KEMPHRENG) indicates vowel length and was difficult to shape correctly until OpenType engines were [updated](https://github.com/notofonts/limbu/issues/3).

Minimal pairs of words showing how the kemphreng is used are [documented](vowel_length.pdf) ([source file](vowel_length.docx)).
