# Story

This story was never published so I don't have a PDF or scan of it, so the attachment is a screenshot of the display in Notepad on Windows XP, where it displays correctly. I've circled a few examples of places that are likely to cause problems due to reordering or positioning. Just to be clear, the circled items in the image are _correct_, but they didn't display that way in Notepad on Win7. I notice that in Notepad on Win10, most of them do display OK, so it seems the USE has been updated. Exceptions are the first and last circled items. If you open the txt file in Notepad on Win10 you'll see that the dots in the first line are correctly positioned horizontally but they're too high. And in the last circled item the dots in Win10 Notepad are too far to the right (in addition to being too high).
